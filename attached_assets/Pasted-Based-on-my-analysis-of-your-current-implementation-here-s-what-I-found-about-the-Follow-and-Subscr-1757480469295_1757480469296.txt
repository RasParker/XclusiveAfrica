Based on my analysis of your current implementation, here's what I found about the Follow and Subscribe button functionality:

Current Button Functionality
Follow Button:

Purpose: Free social engagement to stay updated with creator activity
Action: Updates follower count, shows in feeds/notifications
Location: Both Explore page (creator cards) and creator profiles
User Experience: Simple one-click action with immediate feedback
Subscribe Button:

Purpose: Paid access to exclusive content through subscription tiers
Action: Opens tier selection → payment process → access to premium content
Location: Both Explore page and creator profiles
User Experience: Shows pricing (e.g., "Subscribe from GHS X/month")
Analysis of Potential Competition
Yes, there is some UX friction between these buttons on the Explore page:

Decision Paralysis: Users see 3 buttons (Follow, View Profile, Subscribe) and might hesitate about which action to take first

Hierarchy Confusion: Both Follow and Subscribe are primary actions but serve different purposes - this can confuse users about the relationship between following and subscribing

Discovery Flow Disruption: The Explore page is for discovery, and having too many action options might overwhelm users in their browsing experience

Recommendation
I'd suggest keeping the Follow button only on creator profiles and removing it from the Explore page. Here's why:

For Explore Page:

Focus on "View Profile" and "Subscribe" buttons only
"View Profile" allows users to learn more about the creator before making any commitment
"Subscribe" is the primary monetization action you want to drive
Cleaner, less cluttered interface focused on discovery and conversion
For Creator Profiles:

Keep all three buttons (Follow, View Content, Subscribe)
Users have more context about the creator and can make informed decisions
Following makes more sense after users have explored the creator's content and bio
This approach creates a clearer user journey: Discover → Explore Profile → Follow/Subscribe

Would you like me to implement this change by removing the Follow button from the Explore page creator cards?
