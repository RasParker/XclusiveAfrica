Planned Pay Per View integration strategy (5 seconds)
The user is asking about implementing Pay Per View functionality where fans can pay to view exclusive content, with payment going directly to creators' wallets. Let me think about this:

First, I should search the codebase to understand the current payment/subscription system
Look for existing Stripe integration or payment processing
Understand the content access control system
Then propose a solution for PPV integration
The feedback suggests I should call search_codebase to understand the existing implementation before proposing a solution. This makes sense.

Let me search for:

Payment processing/Stripe integration
Subscription/tier system
Content access control
Database schema for payments/transactions
I'm in Plan mode, so I should be conversational and then provide a task list if we decide to implement this.

Great question! Pay Per View would be a powerful monetization option alongside subscriptions. Let me first understand what's already in place for payments and content access control.

Planned PPV payment integration strategy (8 seconds)
Perfect! I can see your platform currently uses Paystack for subscription payments with a monthly payout system to creators. Let me outline how we can add Pay Per View functionality:

Current Payment System Overview:
Subscription-based: Fans subscribe to tiers, get access to all content at that tier level
Monthly payouts: Creator earnings are calculated monthly and paid out via mobile money/bank transfer
Access control: Content is locked/unlocked based on active subscription tier
Pay Per View Implementation Approach:
1. Database Changes
Add a new table to track individual content purchases:

ppv_purchases {
  id, user_id, post_id, amount, transaction_id, purchased_at
}

Add PPV pricing to posts:

posts {
  // Add new fields:
  is_ppv: boolean
  ppv_price: decimal
  ppv_currency: text
}

2. Modified Access Control
Update the content access logic to check:

User is creator (always has access) OR
Content is public OR
User has active subscription with appropriate tier OR
NEW: User has purchased this specific content via PPV
3. Payment Flow
When user clicks "Unlock" on PPV content:

Show PPV payment modal (similar to subscription modal but simpler)
Initialize one-time Paystack payment
On successful payment → Record in ppv_purchases table
Immediately grant access to that specific content
Payment goes to creator's earnings (available for payout)
4. Creator Wallet Options
For "direct to creator wallet", we have two approaches:

Option A: Keep Monthly Payouts (Safer, more sustainable)

PPV earnings accumulate like subscription earnings
Paid out monthly via existing payout system
Platform takes fee (e.g., 10-15%)
Option B: Instant Transfers (More complex)

Require creators to set up Paystack subaccount
Payments split automatically (creator gets 85-90%, platform 10-15%)
Creator receives funds within 24-48 hours
Need Paystack Split Payment API
Questions for you:
Wallet preference: Do you want instant transfers to creator wallets, or is the monthly payout system acceptable for PPV too?
Pricing: Should creators set PPV price per content piece, or have preset price tiers?
Access duration: Once someone pays for PPV content, do they get permanent access or time-limited (e.g., 30 days)?
Both models: Can a single piece of content be available both via subscription AND PPV? (e.g., "Subscribe or pay $5 to unlock this video")
Let me know your preferences and I'll create a detailed implementation plan!

Before I answer your questions, what will be your recommendation(s) for me regarding question 3 and 4 taking African content monetization into perspective?

Decided on PPV access and pricing (9 seconds)
Excellent question! Let me give you recommendations specifically for the African content monetization landscape:

Question 3: Access Duration
Recommendation: Permanent Access

Here's why this works better for African markets:

Data costs matter: In many African markets, data is expensive. If users pay for content and then lose access after 30 days, they feel pressured to download/watch immediately, which creates friction. Permanent access means they can revisit content when they have WiFi or cheaper data plans.

Trust building: Permanent access builds trust. New platforms need to prove value, and "pay once, keep forever" is a clearer, more trustworthy proposition than time-limited access.

Simpler messaging: "Unlock this video for GHS 5" is easier to understand than "Rent for 30 days for GHS 5". Simplicity drives conversions.

Social sharing: When users know they have permanent access, they're more likely to recommend content to friends, creating organic marketing.

Question 4: Both Subscription AND PPV
Recommendation: Yes, offer BOTH models simultaneously

This is critical for African markets:

Why this dual model works:
Economic flexibility: Not everyone can commit to recurring monthly subscriptions. PPV allows casual fans to engage with specific premium content they really want without the commitment.

Conversion funnel: PPV acts as a "trial" - fans who pay for 2-3 videos might realize a subscription is better value and convert. You're not leaving money on the table from users who would never subscribe but will pay for specific content.

Price optimization:

Make PPV slightly more expensive per piece (e.g., $2-3 per video)
Make subscription the better deal (e.g., $8/month for unlimited tier content)
This incentivizes subscription while still capturing PPV revenue
Proven in African streaming: ShowMax, iROKOtv, and Boomplay all use variations of this model successfully.

Example Pricing Structure:
Creator's Premium Content:
- Subscribe: GHS 20/month (unlimited access to all premium content)
- Pay Per View: GHS 5 per video (permanent access to that one video)
Logic: If someone watches 5+ videos/month, subscription is better value

Implementation approach:
Display both options on locked content: "Subscribe for GHS 20/mo OR Unlock this video for GHS 5"
Track user behavior - if they've paid for 3+ PPV items, show a banner suggesting subscription saves money
Let subscribers still have their PPV purchases even if they cancel (permanent access maintained)
This maximizes revenue by capturing both committed fans (subscriptions) and casual viewers (PPV) while providing clear value proposition for each segment.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this dual model approach?

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Trust elements:

Show exactly what they're getting
"Permanent access" reassurance
Same payment methods as subscriptions
Clear, honest pricing
5. User Purchase History
Add a new section in fan dashboard:

My Unlocked Content
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Video Thumb]  World's Best...   │
│ Purchased: Dec 10, 2024 • GHS 5  │
│ [Watch Again]                    │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Video Thumb]  Aspect ratio...   │
│ Purchased: Dec 5, 2024 • GHS 5   │
│ [Watch Again]                    │
└──────────────────────────────────┘

6. Creator Dashboard Analytics
Add PPV metrics alongside subscription stats:

Revenue Overview
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  This Month: GHS 250                │
│  ├─ Subscriptions: GHS 180 (72%)   │
│  └─ PPV Sales: GHS 70 (28%)        │
│                                     │
│  Top Selling PPV Content:           │
│  1. Video Title - 14 sales (GHS 70)│
│  2. Another Video - 8 sales (GHS 40)│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

7. Smart Conversion Prompts
Track user behavior and show contextual prompts:

After 2-3 PPV purchases:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💡 You've unlocked 3 videos        │
│                                     │
│  Save GHS 20 with a subscription!   │
│  Get unlimited access for GHS 20/mo │
│                                     │
│  [Subscribe Now] [Maybe Later]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

This nudges PPV buyers toward subscriptions when it makes financial sense.

My Top Recommendation:
Start with these 3 core integrations:

✅ Locked Content Overlay - The conversion point (highest priority)
✅ Creator Upload Form - Enable PPV pricing
✅ Feed Indicators - Show PPV badges so users know what's available
Then add:
4. Purchase history page

Creator analytics
Smart conversion prompts
This gives you a working PPV system quickly, and you can iterate based on real user behavior.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this? I can create a detailed task list breaking down the database, backend, and frontend work needed.

46 seconds of work
Can you rather create a step by step detailed guide document in replit (like a .md file) so that we can build this PPV feature in phases instead of onetime by using the .md file as reference?
